### PROBLEM STATEMENT

This project explores historical trends in FIFA World Cup tournaments from 1930 to 2014, focusing on team performances, match outcomes, and tournament statistics. 

Key questions include:
- Total goals scored in each World Cup year.
- Average Goals Per Match Over the Years
- Countries with the highest total goals.
- Matches with the highest number of goals.
- Analyzing African teams' performances, including total goals scored and average match attendance.
- The analysis aims to uncover patterns and provide insights into future tournament predictions based on historical data.

### DATA SOURCES

The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle, specifically the [FIFA World Cup Dataset (1930-2014)](https://www.kaggle.com/abecklas/fifa-world-cup). It contains detailed information about the tournamentâ€™s outcomes, including teams, goals scored, stages reached, and match dates.

### TOOL
Jupyter Notebook

### SKILLS DEMONSTRATED

Multiple functions from the Python and Pandas libraries were used during the data wrangling and cleaning phase of this project. The following libraries were imported for the analysis:
- Python standard libraries.
- Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.

### DATA CLEANING AND DATA PREPARATION

After loading the dataset, the following steps were taken during the cleaning process:
- The data was assessed both visually and programmatically to identify potential issues.
- A copy of the original dataset was created to preserve the raw data.
- Data quality issues were addressed, such as correcting wrong data types.
- A new column, [Is_African_Team], was added to identify the number of African countries that participated in the World Cup.
- A column was created to calculate the Total Goals by summing the 'Home Team Goals' and 'Away Team Goals,' making the analysis easier.

  

  ### VISUALIZATIONS AND INSIGHTS

  Various visualizations were created to better understand the historical trends of the FIFA World Cup:
- Line plots were used to showcase the progression of goals scored over time.

  ### RESULTS

- World Cup goals have increased over the years, with notable peaks in 1954, 1982, 2002, and 2014. Fluctuations occurred in the 1960s-70s, while the 1990s-2014 showed stability, reflecting changes in team strategies and tournament formats.
- From 1930 to the 1950s, World Cup matches saw increasing goals, peaking in the 1950s. A sharp decline followed, with goals stabilizing around 2.5-3.5 per match from the 1970s onward, reflecting evolving tactics and balanced play styles
- Brazil had the highest number of total goals.

 ### CONCLUSION

- The chart provides a clear visualization of how the total goals per World Cup year have evolved over time, reflecting the changing dynamics of the tournament. The peaks suggest years with particularly high-scoring matches, while the overall trend indicates growth in the number of goals scored as the World Cup expanded and evolved.
- The data suggests that the FIFA World Cup saw a high-scoring period in the early tournaments, with a peak in the 1950s. However, the average goals per match decreased and stabilized in later years, indicating possible changes in tactics, defensive strategies, or the increasing competitiveness of teams.
